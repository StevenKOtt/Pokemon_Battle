 # Instructions

Choose your pokemon choice on the left hand side. Once ready to start, player 1 will go first. Last pokemon standing wins.
# Steps of Approach
-first made the battle field and then the Pokedex.
-Spent time on hoping data from player 1 then player 2.

### Current Problems 
*Didn't put percentages like a bobo.
*We want pokemon cries
*Can't filter out based off no power as it froze.

### Add-ons later
*More than 1 pokemon fight at a time.
*filtering based on power > 0 and adding more complex.
*Better code documentation
