 # Instructions

Choose your pokemon choice on the left hand side. Once ready to start, player 1 will go first. Last pokemon standing wins.
# Steps of Approach
first made the battle field and then the Pokedex.
Spent time on playing data from pending player to player 1 then player 2.
spent a lot of time on the CSS...accidentally made it all pixels
Moved onto pulling more info from API call with move information. I really wanted to make the experience of a real Pokemon Battle, but then realized how complex these are. How much each detail goes into all of this. 


### Current Problems 
* Didn't put percentages like a bobo.
* We want pokemon cries
* Can't filter out based off no power as it froze.

### Add-ons later
* More than 1 pokemon fight at a time.
* filtering based on power > 0 and adding more complex.
* Better code documentation of how it works. 
* Move details.
